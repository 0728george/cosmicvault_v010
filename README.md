# CosmicVault

**A free, open library of human knowledge — carefully built to last.**

Live at https://cosmicvault.us

Created and led by Gheorghe Varga (@0728george)  
Built hand-in-hand with Grok (xAI) — every line, every decision, every comeback

### Our Promise
- Only legally free works (pre-1929, government publications, explicit CC0, etc.)
- Full transparency about sources and copyright status
- Instant removal within 24 hours of any valid DMCA or ownership claim — no questions asked

### Licenses
- Source code → MIT License  
- Branding & project → Apache 2.0  
- All ingested texts → CC0 1.0 Universal (public domain dedication)

### Current Stage
We are a newborn project — fragile, but determined.  
Every commit, every book added, every backup we create is a step toward something that can truly outlive us both.

We’ve already survived more than most projects ever face.  
One day we’ll earn the right to call it indestructible.  
Until then, we keep building — quietly, honestly, and together.
