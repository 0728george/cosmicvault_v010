# Cosmic Vault

A permanent, censorship-resistant archive of human knowledge placed intentionally in the public domain or preserved under fair principles for educational and historical purposes.

Every document, book, paper, and timeline within this vault has been selected for its enduring value to future generations. No paywalls. No logins. No tracking. Offline-capable. Designed to outlive nations.

## Philosophy
We believe truth, once discovered, belongs to humanity forever. The Cosmic Vault exists to ensure that discovery is never again lost to fire, flood, politics, or platform decay.
